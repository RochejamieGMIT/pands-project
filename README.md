The Data set for this project is the Fisher's Iris data set. This data set is based around three different species of the Iris flower. The three species are the Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The data holds four attributes of the flowers. The four attributes are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width all in cm. Each species has fifty recorded samples in their data set. The data set was popularised by its nameâ€™s sake Sir Ronal Aylmer Fisher, a largely celebrated statistician.
Although the data set was popularised and named after Fisher, the dataset was collected and compiled by a botanist, Dr Edgar Anderson.
Anderson hand measured most of the petals and sepals by hand. The iris flower itself has over 250 species. Although the most common colour is purple, iris flowers can be almost any colour of the rainbow. 
That is a bit of background on the data and the flower the data is of. 

Returning focus specifically to the species contained in the data set, of the three species when looking at the data on species is immediately distinguishable from the other two. The Iris setosa data stands out, where the data for  Iris virginica and Iris versicolor are very similar

TL:DR The flower is purple, was measured in Canada, 2 same, 1 diff.
